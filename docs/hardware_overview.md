### CH342 Converter
The CH342 serial-to-USB converter allows users to interface with the `UART1` port of the LG580P GNSS module through the USB-C connector. Although the CH342 provides a dual-channel UART interface, only a single channel is utilized to communicate with the LG580P GNSS module. To utilize the CH342, users may need to install a USB driver, which can be downloaded from the [manufacturer website](https://www.wch-ic.com/search?q=CH342&t=downloads).

Once the USB driver is installed:

- Two virtual `COM` ports will be emulated, which can be used as standard `COM` ports to access the receiver.
- Users should select UART port with the enumeration labeled as `Channel A`.

## Power
The Quad-band GNSS RTK breakout board only requires **3.3V** to power the board's primary components. The simplest method to power the board is through the USB-C connector. Alternatively, the board can also be powered through the other connectors and [PTH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Through-hole_technology "Plated Through Holes") pins.

<figcaption markdown>Quad-band GNSS RTK breakout board's power connections.</figcaption>
</figure>

Below, is a general summary of the power circuitry for the board:

<div class="annotate" markdown>

- **`5V`** - The voltage from the USB-C connector, usually **5V**.
	- Can be utilized as the primary power source for the entire board.
- **`3V3`** - 3.3V power rail, which powers the LG580P GNSS module, backup battery, and the power LED.
	- Power can also be distributed to/from any of the `3V3` PTH pins or JST connectors *(Qwiic or `UART3`)*.
		- For power that is supplied through these connections, the LG580P requires a supply voltage of **3.0â€“3.6V**.
	- A regulated **3.3V** is supplied by the [RT9080](./assets/component_documentation/DS9080.pdf), when powered from the `5V` PTH pin or USB connector
		- Input Voltage Range: **1.2 to 5.5V** (1)
		- The RT9080 LDO regulator can source up to 600mA.
- **`3V3_EN`** - Controls the power output from the RT9080 voltage regulator.
	- By default, the pin is pulled-up to 5V and to enable the RT9080 output voltage.
- **`RST`** - Used to reset the LG580P GNSS module
	- Connected to the [`RESET_N` pin](#pio-pins) of the LG580P module, a system pin with an internal pull-up resistor.
	- Driving the pin `LOW` for at least 100ms and releasing it, triggers a hard reset.
- **`GND`** - The common ground or the 0V reference for the voltage supplies.
- [**Backup Battery**](#backup-battery) - Provides backup power to the GNSS module to maintain ephemeris data

</div>

1. While the [RT9080](./assets/component_documentation/DS9080.pdf) LDO regulator has an input voltage range of 1.2 - 5.5V, a minimum supply voltage of **3.5V** is recommended for a 3.3V output.


!!! tip "JST Connector"
	The `VCC` pin of the [JST connector](#jst-connector) is designed to operate as a voltage output. However, an input voltage can be supplied through the pin, but users should be mindful of any voltage contention issues.

	Additionally, the `VSEL` jumper can be modified to change to output voltage level of the `VCC` pin.


!!! tip "BlueSMiRF Header"
	The `3V3` pin of the [BlueSMiRF header](#bluesmirf-header) is designed to operate as a voltage output. However, an input voltage can be supplied through the pin, but users should be mindful of any voltage contention issues.

	Additionally, the `BT-VCC` jumper can be modified to change to output voltage level of the `3V3` pin.

	!!! warning "Feature Under Development"
		Corrections for some of the PPP services have not been implemented.


!!! info
	For a comparison of the frequency bands supported by the LG580P GNSS modules, refer to sections **1.2**, **1.5**, and **1.6** of the [hardware design manual](./assets/component_documentation/quectel_lg580p03_hardware_design_v1-0.pdf).


??? tip "What are Frequency Bands?"
	A [frequency band](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_band) is a section of the [electromagnetic spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum), usually denoted by the range of its upper and lower limits. In the [radio spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_spectrum), these frequency bands are usually regulated by region, often through a government entity. This regulation prevents the interference of RF communication; and often includes major penalties for any interference with critical infrastructure systems and emergency services.

	<figure markdown>
	[![GNSS frequency bands](https://gssc.esa.int/navipedia/images/c/cf/GNSS_All_Signals.png){ width="400" }](https://gssc.esa.int/navipedia/images/c/cf/GNSS_All_Signals.png "Click to enlarge")

	</figure>

	However, if the various GNSS constellations share similar frequency bands, then how do they avoid interfering with one another? Without going too far into detail, the image above helps illustrate some of the characteristics, specific to the frequency bands of each system. With these characteristics in mind, along with other factors, the chart can help users to visualize how multiple GNSS constellations might co-exist with each other.

	- [GALILEO Signal Plan](https://gssc.esa.int/navipedia/index.php?title=GALILEO_Signal_Plan)


### GNSS Accuracy
The accuracy of the position reported from the LG580P GNSS module, can be improved based upon the correction method being employed. Currently, [RTK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_kinematic_positioning "Real-Time Kinematic") corrections provide the highest level of accuracy; however, users should be aware of certain limitations of the system:

- RTK technique requires real-time correction data from a reference station or network of base stations.
	- RTK corrections usually come from RTCM messages that are signal specific *(i.e. an RTK network may only provide corrections for specific signals; only `E5b` and not `E5a`)*.
- The range of the base stations will vary based upon the method used to transmit the correction data.
- The reliability of RTK corrections are inherently reduced in [multipath environments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multipath_propagation).

			All of the UART ports support firmware updates through their interface. In addition, the `UART1` port also supports debugging data and the `UART3` interface can be multiplexed for the CAN bus interface[^1].

	</div>

	</div>


	=== "`UART1`"
		`UART1` can only be accessed from the [USB-C connector](#usb-c-connector), through the CH342 serial-to-USB converter. For Windows and MacOS computers, a [USB driver must be installed](#ch342-converter) in order to communicate with the LG580P module through the CH342 converter; however for Linux operating systems, the standard Linux CDC-ACM driver is suitable. Once the USB driver has been installed:

		- Two virtual `COM` ports are emulated, which can be used as standard `COM` ports to access the receiver.
		- Users should select `COM` port with the lower enumeration or listed as `Channel A`.


	=== "`UART2`"
		`UART2` is available through the breakout [PTH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Through-hole_technology "Plated Through Holes") pins or the [BlueSMiRF header pins](#bluesmirf-header). The pin layout of the BlueSMiRF header is pin compatible with many of our serial devices (i.e. [UART adapters](https://www.sparkfun.com/categories/349), [*serial* data loggers](https://www.sparkfun.com/categories/589), [BlueSMiRF transceivers](https://www.sparkfun.com/categories/tags/bluesmirf)).


	=== "`UART3`"
		`UART3` is available through the [JST connector](#jst-connector). The pin layout of the 4-pin locking JST-GH connector is compatible with many of our [serial radios and adapter cables](hardware_assembly.md#radio-transceivers).


	??? info "UART Protocols"
		#### UART Protocols
		By default, these UART ports are configured to transmit and receive `NMEA 0183`, `RTCM 3.x`, and/or `QGC` messages. These messages are generally used for transmitting PNT data; providing or receiving RTK corrections; and receiving PPP data, respectively. Quectel also implements a system of proprietary messages (`PQTM`) for users to configure the LG580P that follows a data format similar to the `NMEA` protocol. The expected structure of these proprietary messages is shown below:

## SMA Connectors
There are two SMA connectors on the Quad-band GNSS RTK breakout board. The `Antenna-1` connector is the primary input for a GNSS antenna for the LG580P GNSS receiver. The `Antenna-2` connector operates as a secondary GNSS antenna input to provide a heading and pitch solution from the LG580P GNSS receiver.

</figure>


!!! warning "Antenna Specifications"
	- Passive antennas are not recommended for the LG580P GNSS module.
	- To mitigate the impact of out-of-band signals, utilize an active antenna whose SAW filter is placed in front of the LNA in the internal framework.
		- **DO NOT** select and antenna with the LNA placed in the front.
	- There is no need to inject an external DC voltage into the SMA connector for the GNSS antenna. Power is already provided from the LG580P module for the LNA of an active antenna.


!!! tip
	For the best performance, we recommend users choose compatible L1/L2/L5/L6/L-Band GNSS antennas and utilize a low-loss cables. Also, don't forget that GNSS signals are fairly weak and can't penetrate buildings or dense vegetation. The GNSS antennas should have an unobstructed view of the sky.



## JST Connector
The Quad-band GNSS RTK breakout features a 4-pin [JST GH connector](./assets/component_documentation/JST-GH_datasheet.pdf), which is polarized and locking. Users can access pins of the `UART3` port with our [breadboard cable](https://www.sparkfun.com/breadboard-to-jst-ghr-04v-cable-4-pin-x-1-25mm-pitch.html). Otherwise, the connector's pin layout is compatible with any of our [serial radios and adapter cables](hardware_assembly.md#radio-transceivers).

???+ tip "Jumpers"
	By default, the [`VSEL` jumper](#jumpers) is connected to `3V3` pad for a regulated 3.3V output on the 4-pin JST-GH connector.



## BlueSMiRF Header
The Quad-band GNSS RTK breakout features a 6-pin BlueSMiRF [PTH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Through-hole_technology "Plated Through Holes") header for `UART2`. The pin layout of which, is compatible with many of our serial devices (i.e. [UART adapters](https://www.sparkfun.com/categories/349), [*serial* data loggers](https://www.sparkfun.com/categories/589), [BlueSMiRF transceivers](https://www.sparkfun.com/categories/tags/bluesmirf)).

<div markdown>

- `PWR` - Power *(Red)*
	- Turns on once 3.3V power is supplied to the board
- `PPS` - [Pulse-Per-Second](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-per-second_signal) Signal *(Yellow)*
	- Indicates when there is a pulse-per-second signal *(see the **[PPS Output](#pps-output)** section)*
- `PVT` - Position-Velocity-Time Solution *(Blue)*
	- **On:** Indicates the module has entered PVT mode
	- **Off:** Indicates that the module has exited PVT mode or is in [Backup mode](#power-modes).
- `RTK` - [Real-Time Kinematic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_kinematic_positioning) Mode *(White)*
	- Indicates when an RTK fix has been established or when the correct RTCM data is being received *(see the **[RTK](#rtk)** section)*
- `HEAD` - Heading Solution *(Green)*
	- **On:** Indicates the module has entered Heading fixed mode
	- **Off:** Indicates that the module has exited Heading fixed mode or is in [Backup mode](#power-modes).

</div>

</div>


!!! info
	- The [`PPS`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-per-second_signal "Pulse Per Second") LED is also connected to the [`PPS` pin](#pps-output).
	- The [`RTK`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_kinematic_positioning "Real-Time Kinematic") LED is also connected to the [`RTK` pin](#rtk).


???+ tip "Jumpers"
	There are jumper attached to the LEDs. For low power applications, these jumpers can be cut to disable their respective LED. *See the **[Jumpers](#jumpers)** section for more details.*

		**How to Work with Jumper Pads and PCB Traces**</a>

	</div>


There are seven jumpers on the back of the board that can be used to easily modify the hardware connections on the board. From which, there are three jumpers that control power to the status LEDs on the board. By default, all the jumpers are connected, to power the status LEDs. For low power applications, users can cut the jumpers to disconnect power from each of the LEDs.

- **`VSEL`** - This jumper can be modified to configure/disconnect the `VCC` pin of the 4-pin locking JST connector to/from `3V3` or `5V` power.
- **`BT_VCC`** - This jumper can be cut to disconnect the `3V3` BlueSMiRF header pin from the 3.3V output of the RT9080 LDO regulator.
- **`PWR`** - This jumper can be cut to remove power from the red, power LED.
- **`PPS`** - This jumper can be cut to remove power from the yellow `PPS` LED, indicating when there is a [PPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-per-second_signal "Pulse Per Second") signal.
- **`PVT`** - This jumper can be cut to remove power from the blue `PVT` LED, indicating a PVT solution or operation in PVT mode.
- **`RTK`** - This jumper can be cut to remove power from the white `RTK` LED, indicating RTK fix or operation in RTK mode.
- **`HEADING`** - This jumper can be cut to remove power from the green `HEAD` LED, indicating a heading solution or operation in Heading fixed mode.
- **`SHLD`** - This jumper can be cut to disconnect the shielding of the USB-C connector from the `GND` plane of the board


!!! info
	- By default, the `VSEL` jumper is connected to `3V3` pad for a regulated 3.3V output on the 4-pin JST-GH connector.
	- By default, the `BT_VCC` jumper provides a regulated 3.3V output to the BlueSMiRF header.
